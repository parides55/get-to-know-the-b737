# BOEING 737

The initial idea for this website came from the fact that there are a lot of aviation enthousiasts out there who constantly looking to learn more about aviation and aircraft so I decided to build this website to give some historic facts and basic technical details about the Boeing 737, one of the most used aircraft in the world. Altought, there plenty websites available with a lot of information about aircraft, this website is looking to present all these inforamtion not only by reading but also through images and videos.

## Features 

The website consists of one page which can be scrolled down to view all the content. The landing page has a big hero image which is aiming to attract immediately the attention of the user and invite the user to scroll further down for more information. On the right top corner of the header there is a navigation bar, which can be used to easily navigate to any part of the website. Also, in the bottom right corner there is a Home Button, fixed in position, which when pressed it takes the user all the way up to the header, where the navigation bar is, and further selections can be made. Below the landing page, is the History section where the history of the aircraft is described. Also, some videos are included to give further information. Scrollind further down the user can enjoy some very engaging and informative pictures about the technical characteristic of the mostly used variants of the Boeing 737 and a table which presents the performance characteristics of those variants. Before reaching the Footer, the user can watch images of all Boeing 737 variants in the gallery section and which can be opened in a seperated tab for better viewing. Lastly, in the Footer, the user can send a message to the website and also send some of the pictures that the user might have to the website throught the social media, which can be accessed by clicking on the social media icons.
