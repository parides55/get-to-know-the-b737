# GET TO KNOW THE BOEING 737

The initial idea for this website came from the fact that there are a lot of aviation enthousiasts out there who constantly looking to learn more about aviation and aircraft so I decided to build this website to give some historic facts and basic technical details about the Boeing 737, one of the most used aircraft in the world. Altought, there plenty websites available with a lot of information about aircraft, this website is looking to present all these inforamtion not only by reading but also through images and videos.

## Features 

The website consists of one page which can be scrolled down to view all the content. The home page has a big hero image which is looking to attract immediately the attention of the user and invite the user to scroll further down for more information. On the right top corner of the header there is a navigation bar, which can be used to easily navigate to any part of the website. Also, in the bottom right corner there is a Home Button, fixed in position, which when pressed it takes you all the way up to the header, where the navigation bar is, and further selections can be made.
